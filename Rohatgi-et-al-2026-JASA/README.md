## Overview

</p>

Coherent summation of multichannel recordings relies on phase stability across measurements. In scattered wavefields, near-surface heterogeneities introduce record-dependent phase distortions that decorrelate otherwise coherent signals and degrade summation quality. Conventional approaches to recovering phase coherence implicitly tie phase estimation to signal amplitude, introducing bias where amplitude variability is large.

We present a framework based on circular statistics that separates phase estimation from amplitude entirely, ensuring all records contribute equally to the representative phase regardless of their energy. The key contribution is **phase masking via the circular mean (PCM)**, which normalizes spectra to unit magnitude prior to averaging, decoupling phase estimation from amplitude by construction.

Synthetic experiments confirm that PCM outperforms conventional phase masking via local stack (PLS) when amplitude variability is present, offering a practical path toward more robust coherence recovery in seismic imaging and other wave-based sensing applications.

  <em>Phase variance spectra before and after phase masking under uniform and variable amplitude conditions. PCM maintains consistently lower phase variance than PLS when amplitude variability is present.</em>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (≥ 1.9 recommended)

### Install Pluto

Launch Julia and install the Pluto package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Pluto")
```

### Run the Notebook

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arohatgi29/SeismicPhaseStatistics.git
